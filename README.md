# Data-Cleaning and Preprocessing Tool
Welcome to the Data Cleaning and preprocessing tool! This project focuses on developing a Python-based tool that automates the process of cleaning and preprocessing data, thereby improving data quality.

# Project Description
This project focuses on:
1.Cleaning a dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, outlier detection and libraries used
2.Provide clean data suitable for analysis or modeling.
3.Saving the cleaned dataset for future use.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and handling arrays.

 # Methodology
1.Handling Missing Values
Missing data can lead to inaccurate models. This step involves:
(i)Identifying NaN or null values in the dataset.
(ii)Techniques for handling missing values:
       Removal: Dropping rows or columns with excessive missing data.
       Imputation:
         Mean Imputation
         Median Imputation
         Mode Imputation
 2.Duplicate Removal
 Duplicate entries can skew model results. This step:
(i)Identifies duplicate rows.
(ii)Removes them using:
3. Outlier Detection
Outliers can distort statistical analyses and models. This step uses:
(i)Z-score Method
(ii)Interquartile Range (IQR) Method

# Implementation
The tool is implemented as a Python script that:
1.Loads a dataset (CSV).
2.Applies each of the preprocessing steps.
3.Outputs the cleaned dataset.

# Results
The tool successfully:
1.Identifies and handles missing values.
2.Removes duplicate records.
3.Detects and processes outliers.
4.Outputs a cleaned version of the input dataset.

# Applications
This tool can be used in:
1.Preprocessing data for machine learning models.
2.Improving data quality in analytics projects.
3.Reducing manual effort in data cleaning tasks.

# Conclusion
The Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Tool automates essential data preparation tasks. By using Python and its powerful libraries, the tool efficiently handles common data quality issues, saving time and ensuring better model performance.
